# Dad-A journey
 Your son wants pudding but you got no milk in the house, so as a good father you make yourself onto the journey of getting milk.
 Who would have thought that it would end up taking so long and would be so dangerous to get to the grocery store - you certainly didn't.

 From angry neighbours over sewage workers to the cashier, some people just don't want you to succeed and return to your son. Will you become another dad that never returned from getting milk?
