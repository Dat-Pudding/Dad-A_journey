  itemDescriptions:
  - As you learned from your father, this type of plant is the ideal emergency treatment
    for wounds - as long as it's not life-threatening that is.
  - Keys unlock things. But why does everyone seemingly have the same lock everwhere?
  - If you can get enough of them, maybe with some glue you can get an as-good-as-new
    pot?
  - No one understands wherefrom this pot draws seemingly infinite energy. One guy
    who tried looking into the opening got immediately incinerated. Just be grateful
    that it doesn't burn your hands while holding it!
  - Your pot runneth over!
  - Don't get this near your ears, you will hear it - once
  - Less bright than a modern flashlight. And way more clunky and cumbersome to handle.
    And a lot heavier as well. But hey, it works without batteries!
  - As empty vessels make the loudest sound. ~ P
